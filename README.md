Here's a place to store all our files for our python learning endeavor

#GitHub for Complete Newbies

git clone - clone or pull down a new repository

git status - verifies files with given branch (can show new files)

git add - starts update of files within local repository

git commit - (good practice to do with "-m" flag followed by short message in quotes

		Notes good for determining what was done
		
		Places in "staging area" - think of this as a version update
		
git push - (use "-u" for upstream) pushes from local to GitHub, use "origin" "master"

		Example: git push -u origin master
		
git pull - grabs all new files from GitHub to local
