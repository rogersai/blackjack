Doing things this way because I still don't understand Git, GitHub, or best practices, hah

"basic_blackjack.py"

My attempt at developing a working blackjack sim with my current level of programming knowledge.
Everything technically works, but there's quite a lot of room for improvement - both for user interaction and code cleanup.
(There are several things done inefficiently, but I have not yet learned a better method.)

#Working#
+ Basic card dealing (by numeric value, not name)
+ Value switching of an ace between 1 and 11 based on current hand
+ Dealer will hit until reaching a hand value of 17 or greater
+ Both player and dealer can bust
+ Player can win on 5 card draw rule
+ Player/Dealer Blackjack is recognized and exits the program

#Not working or implemented#
- Player betting
- Game reset (play again function)
- Blackjack split and double-down rules
- No face card recognition (they'd all simply count as a 10)
- Limit cards based on availability from deck (i.e. you could *technically* draw five 3's in a row)
- Directly related to above: no card limit also means no draw probability (draws are generated by random function)
- Anything else I've forgotten or haven't realized yet

#Could improve#
^ Having to break the iterations of hit/Hit/stand/Stand into "elif" statements is weird, but "AND" does not seem to be
functioning inside a "WHILE" loop. No idea why.
^ The constant "Press Enter to continue..." statements are annoying, but the easiest way I could break things up right now
